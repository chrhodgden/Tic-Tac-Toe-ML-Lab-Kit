# Tic Tac Toe Machine Learning Lab Kit

To run this project, execute play.py.

This is a simple and fun project for me to learn python. Not all the menu items have been set up and will crash if they are selected. The keyboard interface only works with Microsoft Windows OS.

It does not apply proper machine learning techniques. The "machine learning" is aggregating in raw SQL for each occurance. They do infact improve and figure out how to play.

Next steps for this project will be to integrate proper machine learning into the the AI profiles. Then add the rest of the menu elements. 

I may decide to do this in JavaScript and HTML with the Math.js or TensorFlow libraries. The potential for this project is educational. It would be nice to share easily and be more interactive.
